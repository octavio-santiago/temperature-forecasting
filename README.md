# Temperature Forecasting with LSTM Deep Learning Models

This repository contains code for training and evaluating LSTM deep learning models for temperature forecasting. The models are implemented in Python using the Keras library, and are trained on historical temperature data from various locations around the world.

# Getting Started
To use the code in this repository, you will need to have Python 3 and several Python packages installed on your system. You can install the required packages by running the following command:

'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

Once you have installed the required packages, you can run the python scripts the main directory to train and evaluate the LSTM models.

# Data
The historical temperature data used to train the models is stored in the data directory. The data is sourced from the INMET.

# Models
The LSTM models used for temperature forecasting are implemented in the models directory. The lstm_stacked.py and lstm_vanilla.py files contains the code for defining and training the models.

# Evaluation
The performance of the LSTM models is evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) metrics. The evaluation results are presented in the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory.
